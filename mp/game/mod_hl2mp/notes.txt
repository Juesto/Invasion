Invasion Notes

This is a set of notes to stop myself looking into things thinking they're a bug
and finding out shortly after that they're instead by design. Invasion worked very
differently to the final TF2 so I really need to teach myself to keep out of that
mindset. I suppose these will also help anyone else curious as to why certain things
seem to do what they do...

--------------------------

Q.	Where did resources come from?
A.	Right now as far as I understand it, the aliens are responsible for the resources
	that exists in the Invasion phase of Team Fortress 2. There are two things that
	somewhat tell me this; concept art produced by Chuck Jones that shows an alien
	that spits out a large blob, with other elements included along-side this reflecting
	a style that can be seen with the Alien Commando model (circles). 
	Additionally along with the fact that there's an entity called the Resource Spawner 
	that is set up to use an animated model.
	
Q.	Were there meant to be multiple resource types?
A.	It looks like this was intended but never implemented.

Q. 	I've set object limits but can keep on creating objects anyway...
A. 	This is by design, players aren't limited by the number of objects but by
	their resource count instead, by default. There's a console variable however
	that will change how this works; tf2_object_hard_limits, which by default is
	obviously false.
	
Q.	I've given an object a resource cost of 100 only to find that it's using 80
	in-game.
A.	This'll only occur when on the Human team as they automatically get an 8%
	discount on their objects.
	
Q.	I died but didn't lose any resources?
A.	Resources are held by the team, not individual players.

Q.	Why aren't there any sparks when I hit something?
A.	To put it simply, they probably weren't implemented when Invasion was being
	developed. It seems that Invasion used physical models to produce such impact
	effects (which were also disabled due to perf concerns).
